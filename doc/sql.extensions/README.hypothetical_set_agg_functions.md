# Hypothetical-Set Aggregate Functions

Hypothetical set functions include ranking and rank distribution functions, which you are already familiar with as window functions, but they are applied to groups to enter values ​​in hypothetical form.

There are two sorted set ranking functions: `RANK` and `DENSE_RANK`. There are also two sorted set rank distribution functions: `PERCENT_RANK` and `CUME_DIST`. Window functions and ordered set functions differ in the way they order. The former order within a window, while the latter order within a group.

Syntax of aggregate functions of a hypothetical set:

```
<hypothetical-set-agg-function> ::=
      RANK(<args>) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <sorted_args>)
    | DENSE_RANK(<args>) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <sorted_args>)
    | PERCENT_RANK(<args>) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <sorted_args>)
    | CUME_DIST(<args>) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <sorted_args>)
```

Each of the "hypothetical-set" aggregates is associated with a window function of the same name. In each case, the aggregate's result is the value that the associated window function would have returned for the "hypothetical" row constructed from `args`, if such a row had been added to the sorted group of rows represented by the `sorted_args`. For each of these functions, the list of direct arguments given in `args` must match the number and types of the aggregated arguments given in `sorted_args`. Unlike most built-in aggregates, these aggregates are not strict, that is they do not drop input rows containing NULLs. `NULL` values sort according to the rule specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.

The values ​​of the input arguments `args` must be constant within each group.

An example of using hypothetical set functions without grouping:

```sql
SELECT
  RANK(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS R1,
  DENSE_RANK(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS R2,
  PERCENT_RANK(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS PR,
  CUME_DIST(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS CD
FROM EMPLOYEE E;
```

```
                   R1                    R2                      PR                      CD

```

An example of using hypothetical set functions with grouping:

```sql
SELECT
  E.JOB_COUNTRY,
  RANK(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS R1,
  DENSE_RANK(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS R2,
  PERCENT_RANK(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS PR,
  CUME_DIST(35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.SALARY) AS CD
FROM EMPLOYEE E
GROUP BY E.JOB_COUNTRY;
```

```
JOB_COUNTRY                        R1                    R2                      PR                      CD

An example of using hypothetical functions with two arguments:

```sql
SELECT
  RANK('England', 35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.JOB_COUNTRY, E.SALARY) AS R1,
  DENSE_RANK('England', 35500) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY E.JOB_COUNTRY, E.SALARY) AS R2,
